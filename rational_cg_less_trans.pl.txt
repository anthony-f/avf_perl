 As the C of CG's are prone to mutation (e.g.,Hwang & Green; 2004, Proc Natl Acad Sci 101: 13994)
 amino acids encoded by CG-affected codons could bias the outcome of the evolutionary analysis
 of certain proteins especially if the CG's are no longer under purifying selection.

 This consideration is particularly relevant to studies that address the evolution of proteins that
 were encoded by distinct, but now long extinct families, of retrotransposons such as the L1 family
 of non-LTR retrotransposons in mammals. These autonomously replicating elements are basically intragenomic
 parasites and encode two proteins, which are essential for their replication. They have been evolving and
 replicating in mammals for the last 80-120 Myr, and have littered the genome with many thousands of copies of
 their fossilized remnants, which account for almost 20% of the genomic mass of many mammals.
 
 Modern decendants of these families are still active in most present day species, and important clues to
 the evolutionary dynamics and biochemical strategems that ensured their persistence reside in the relics
 of now extince L1 families  

 This script converts amino acids encoded by codon positions affected by CpG's, i.e., (CG.), (.CG) and (..C)(G..)
 to the null amino acid character, "O", which is subsequently converted to missing data symbol "-" by most downstream
 procedures or by sed, awk or any plain text editor. 

 if the name of the input file, test_in.fst, the programs writes output to test-cg-null.fst
 sed 's/O/-/g' test-cg-null.fst > test-cg-null.1.fst

 Conversion to "O" is implemented by the subroutine, get_val which uses the CG-less codon hash

	# "J" = null nucleotide character
	# "-" (not ".") = gap
	# "O" = null amino acid character

	# seq = DNA coding sequence; orth = orthologue; cns = consensus; pep = peptide sequence; o_pep,
	# peptide sequence which the null amino acid character, O, in place of the amino acids encoded
	# by CG-affected codons

 L1Pa6, name of an extinct L1 family the members of which were extracted the human genome data base

 input files in fasta format			output files in fasta format
 say for L1PA6:
				# >l1pa6				>l1pa6
				# cns_seq				cn_os_seq
				# >6_orth_name_1		>6_orth_name_1
				# pep_1					o_pep_1
				# >6_orth_name_2		>6_orth_name_2
				# pep_2					o_pep_2
								
 main program will then convert the positions in the orth pep sequences that correspond
 to the CG-affected codons to the null amino acid symbol, i.e., "O", aa chars of the consensus to "O"

if the name of the input file is test_in.fst, the output file is test-cg-null.fst
the "O" can be changed to the missing data symbol "-" sed 's/O/-/g' test-cg-null.fst > test-cg-null.1.fst
